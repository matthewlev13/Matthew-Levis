## About

I am currently a fourth year computer science student at Oregon State University. I am taking the systems option and I enjoy working in backend software engineering 
with languages like Java, Python, and Javascript. 

I have had two past internships that have helped me understand the professional software engineering environment
and have allowed me to create cool projects. 

Aside from computer science, I enjoy playing music on guitar and piano, exercising and hiking, traveling, studying history
and spending time with my friends and family.

## Projects

[Perro - Senior Project](https://github.com/Jonesy22/Perro)

I am working on a project with three other students to develop an application to track projects for small teams. This will be a full-stack web application that will feature the ability to track sprints and break down each sprint with different tasks. Each user will have the ability to update information related to a sprint and document their tasks. It will be similar to a Jira tracker but more lightweight to appeal to smaller teams.

My work on the project consisted of developing React components for the frontend architecture of the application as well as creating a login feature using oAuth2. The login feature went through Google in order to create accounts that were then put into the database much like other web applications that will create accounts through Google, Facebook, or another popular platform. We were able to host sessions for users using oAuth2 as well. 


[Chord Progression Web App](https://github.com/matthewlev13/music-app)

This is a simple web application built using the MERN stack to allow a user to select a key and generate a chord progression with the option to augment specific chords. It is still in progress but plans include adding a more accessible UI and allow buttons to feature an audio output for a chord.


[Stocks Tracker Application](https://github.com/matthewlev13/MyStocks-Application)

A Stock Tracker application used on iOS devices to track any of the public companies in the NYSE. Uses the IEX API to query intraday stock price information and relevant news from related sources. Unpublished, and an independent project.
